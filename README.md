# Schoolwork

This project is schoolwork with the required specifications written in the pdf files (portuguese).
This was done over two years ago (in 2019) and doesn't represent how I do projects anymore,
but I thought to be nice showing something like this like a museum.

You can try to read it, but I would recommend to not take the commit messages seriously as some of them are literally `Yes.`.

There are some `.txt` files such as `harmony-design.txt` that shows how I design code, though today it is improved.
